# Roastuino-Popper-Roaster

[>>> New Fluid Bed Roaster Project <<<](https://github.com/cyberelectronics/Roastuino-Fluidbed-Roaster/tree/main)

There are a lot of Popper Coffee Roaster modifications on the internet.

This is just another one with PID controller (theoretically this controller can be used on other roasters as well), based on Arduino .

I used the same Espressuino hardware with small modifications.

The software is a mix of 4 Arduino sketches:

1. [BBCC (BareBones Coffee Controller) project by Tim Hirzel](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/BarebonesPIDForEspresso)
2. [Espressuino modifications]()
3. [Serial interface for Roastlogger software used from Roastlogger Project](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/green_bean/coffee/roastlogger/roastlogger.htm)   
4. [Arduino Library for MAX31855 thermocouple amplifier by Adafruit](http://learn.adafruit.com/thermocouple/using-a-thermocouple)

**Operation modes:**

1. Manual Mode
2. Auto Mode
3. PC Control Mode
4. Settings Mode

1. In Manual Mode we can set the Target Temperature and Fan Speed only, the Time setting is unavailable in this Mode. The Fan Speed controlled using PWM signal (100% on LCD or in Roastlogger means max. RPM, this can be used only with DC motors). The Manual Mode can be activated by pressing the + (INCrement) or â€“ (DECrement) button, while the system is in the STOP state. Using the START / STOP button we can START the AUTO Mode OR STOP the Manual Mode AND AUTO Mode. Heater and Servo Output controlled by the PID algorithm. There is a Total Elapsed Time counter in the upper right side of the LCD, which will be activated instantly when the Manual Mode starts. Temperature values can be displayed on Roastlogger or Artisan.
